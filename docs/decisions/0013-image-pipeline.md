# 0013. A generic golden image built by Azure Image Builder, promoted by a person, rotated blue/green

- **Status:** Proposed

## Context
Session hosts come from the marketplace image at `latest`, so two hosts deployed a week apart can differ, and nobody can say which build a host runs. Replacing hosts is a manual procedure. The second brain's `replace-host` playbook, its detections and its baselines need a known image, and the owner decided to build the image pipeline before the second brain (second brain spec Q6).

## Decision
As specified in [image-pipeline-spec.md](../image-pipeline-spec.md):
- **Azure Image Builder, not Packer.** It is Azure-native, defined in Bicep, and runs with a managed identity. That keeps the project to one language.
- **The image is generic.** Updates and a few settings go in. Nothing tenant- or landing-zone-specific does: share paths, tokens, joins and the AVD agent stay with the existing Run Commands. One version serves every environment and adopter.
- **Built monthly and validated automatically; a person promotes to production pools.**
  - A version stays excluded from `latest` until automated validation passes in `test`'s and then `prod`'s QA pools, each with a 24-hour soak. The checks need no user credentials: the preflight, the readiness checks, in-host function checks, and posture as warnings.
  - A failure rolls the QA pool back automatically.
  - Real sign-ins come from QA users and are shown at promotion. Promotion without any needs an acknowledgment.
  - The automation's identity reaches only the QA resource groups. It is registered as pre-approved exception EX-0005.
  - Hosts pin a version ID (`AVD_SESSION_HOST_IMAGE_ID`, guarded with `empty(...)`); the marketplace image stays the default.
- **WDOT on every build:** pinned by version and SHA-256, with a reviewed profile in Git. Services the landing zone needs (Intune push, Defender, Windows Update, search, the RDP stack) are protected by a test and by a build-time check. Appx removal and WDOT's advanced optimizations are off by default.
- **Hosts don't update themselves:** Windows and Microsoft 365 Apps automatic updates are off, per Microsoft's golden image guidance. Patches come through the monthly image. Defender signatures and the AVD agent keep updating.
- **A one-host QA pool in every landing zone** (`AVD_QA_POOL`, on by default). It is a validation environment with an earlier agent update window, the canary for each new image in each environment, and the place for maintenance work. It is a production twin, so it doesn't update itself either.
- **Blue/green rotation** through alternating name generations, by a resumable Cloud Shell script. Its state lives in a host pool tag. It never logs users off unless the operator opts in, and it removes old VMs, session host objects and device objects.
- **Builds run in the build environment's spoke,** reusing its egress, with no public IP. Customizer scripts are pinned by commit and SHA-256.

## Consequences
- Every host's software traces to a commit, a source image version and a build run. Patching becomes a monthly, reviewable promotion.
- One more host per landing zone for the QA pool, counted by the quota and price checks. It only helps if a couple of people sign in to it every day, so the preflight warns when nobody has.
- Rotation needs vCPU quota for a second set of hosts while it runs. Without it, rotation stops at its first check instead of shrinking capacity.
- A gallery, replicas and a build VM per month to pay for, priced at deploy (decision 0010).
- Not verified against a real deployment yet; the spec lists what to confirm at build.
