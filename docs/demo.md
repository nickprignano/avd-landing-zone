# Live demo: a working desktop in a 30-minute slot

A fresh landing zone takes 30–45 minutes to deploy ([deploy.md](deploy.md#4-deploy)). The post-deployment setup and the first sign-in come after that. That is too long, and too uncertain, to fit a 30-minute slot. So the demo works like a cooking show:

- **Dev is built the night before and is the working desktop.** You sign in to it during the demo.
- **Test is deployed live beside it** from [`parameters/test.bicepparam`](../parameters/test.bicepparam). It is the dev footprint under its own names (`avdlz-test`, session hosts `avdlztsh-*`). It leaves the subscription-wide pieces (policy guardrails, activity log export) to dev, so nothing collides.

Every block below is self-contained. Paste it into a fresh [Cloud Shell (PowerShell)](https://shell.azure.com/powershell) and paste the output into the [deployment portal](https://nickprignano.github.io/avd-landing-zone/portal/). The portal tells you what to run next.

## The night before (about 1.5 hours, mostly waiting)

**1. Pre-deployment preflight for dev, with `-Fix`, until it says Ready.** This registers the providers and the EncryptionAtHost feature (about 15 minutes, once per subscription), creates the groups, and recovers a soft-deleted Key Vault.

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path ~/avd-landing-zone)) { git clone https://github.com/nickprignano/avd-landing-zone.git ~/avd-landing-zone }
Set-Location ~/avd-landing-zone; git checkout -q master; git pull -q --ff-only
./scripts/ops/Test-AvdLandingZoneReadiness.ps1 -PreDeployment -ParameterFile parameters/dev.bicepparam -Location northcentralus -UsersGroup 'AVD Users' -AdminsGroup 'AVD Admins' -Fix
```

**2. Deploy dev.** Note the start and end times.

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path ~/avd-landing-zone)) { git clone https://github.com/nickprignano/avd-landing-zone.git ~/avd-landing-zone }
Set-Location ~/avd-landing-zone; git checkout -q master; git pull -q --ff-only
bash ./scripts/deploy/deploy.sh -p parameters/dev.bicepparam -l northcentralus --users-group 'AVD Users' --admins-group 'AVD Admins'
```

**3. Post-deployment setup for dev, with `-Fix`.** It covers admin consent for the storage app, the Conditional Access exclusion and the profile share permissions. It asks for a Microsoft Graph device code.

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path ~/avd-landing-zone)) { git clone https://github.com/nickprignano/avd-landing-zone.git ~/avd-landing-zone }
Set-Location ~/avd-landing-zone; git checkout -q master; git pull -q --ff-only
./scripts/ops/Test-AvdLandingZoneReadiness.ps1 -NamePrefix avdlz -Environment dev -Fix -AllowHostStart
```

**4. Sign in once as the demo user.** Use the [Windows App](https://windows.cloud.microsoft) and open the desktop. This proves the whole path and creates the FSLogix profile, so tomorrow's sign-in is quick. Sign out when you're done.

**5. Where did the minutes go?** Keep this output: it shows the long pole, usually the session host and its extensions.

```powershell
$name = az deployment sub list --query "sort_by([?starts_with(name,'avdlz-dev-')], &properties.timestamp)[-1].name" -o tsv
az deployment operation sub list -n $name --query "[].{step:properties.targetResource.resourceName, state:properties.provisioningState, took:properties.duration}" -o table
```

**6. Pre-deployment preflight for test.** It confirms there is quota for a second host: two `Standard_E4as_v5` hosts need 8 vCPUs of the *Standard EASv5 Family*. If quota is short, the portal builds the increase request, and small increases are usually approved in minutes. Don't deploy test tonight.

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path ~/avd-landing-zone)) { git clone https://github.com/nickprignano/avd-landing-zone.git ~/avd-landing-zone }
Set-Location ~/avd-landing-zone; git checkout -q master; git pull -q --ff-only
./scripts/ops/Test-AvdLandingZoneReadiness.ps1 -PreDeployment -ParameterFile parameters/test.bicepparam -Location northcentralus -UsersGroup 'AVD Users' -AdminsGroup 'AVD Admins' -Fix
```

Dev's scheduled stop deallocates the host at 20:00 Central. That is expected: Start VM on Connect starts it again at the next sign-in.

## 20–30 minutes before the demo

- **Warm the desktop.** Sign in once in the Windows App. Start VM on Connect takes a few minutes to boot the host. Then sign out, or leave the session disconnected.
- **Open these tabs:**
  - the portal, with Deployment settings set to `parameters/test.bicepparam`;
  - a signed-in Cloud Shell;
  - the Windows App;
  - the Azure portal on the `rg-avdlz-dev-*` resource groups.
- **Check that the pre-deployment preflight for test still says Ready.**

## The 30 minutes

| Time | Show |
|---|---|
| 0–5 | **The portal.** The latency check ranks regions from the room. Size the host pool (one E4as_v5 host). On the **Cost** step, flip Start VM on Connect and the scheduled stop, and watch the hours and the price change. |
| 5–8 | **Deploy test live.** Paste the portal's pre-deployment preflight (Ready), then its `deploy.sh` command for `parameters/test.bicepparam`. Explain what it builds while it runs: private networking, FSLogix on Azure Files over Private Link, Entra join, Intune, the scaling plan and auto shutdown. |
| 8–20 | **The working desktop.** Sign in to dev in the Windows App. Show the FSLogix profile, the private endpoints and the NAT Gateway in the Azure portal. Optionally show the Well-Architected review in the portal (Sign in step, then Well-Architected review). |
| 20–28 | **Back to the live deployment.** Paste the portal's "check on it" command, which shows each finished resource. It will likely still be running, which is expected: it keeps going in Azure if Cloud Shell disconnects. |
| 28–30 | Questions. |

## If something goes wrong

- **The live deployment fails.** Paste the output into the portal. It names known errors and gives the command that lists the failed resources. The dev desktop is unaffected: test has its own resource groups.
- **The desktop doesn't connect.** The host may still be starting (Start VM on Connect). Wait a minute and retry. Or run the post-deployment check for dev: its *Host pool* section says whether the host is Available.
- **Cloud Shell disconnects.** The deployment carries on in Azure. The portal's Deploy step has "Already started? Check on it".

## Afterwards

Remove test and keep dev:

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path ~/avd-landing-zone)) { git clone https://github.com/nickprignano/avd-landing-zone.git ~/avd-landing-zone }
Set-Location ~/avd-landing-zone; git checkout -q master; git pull -q --ff-only
./scripts/ops/Remove-AvdDemo.ps1 -NamePrefix avdlz -Environment test -IncludeLandingZone -WhatIf
```

Read the `-WhatIf` output, then run it again without `-WhatIf`. With dev still there, the cleanup keeps what dev uses: the policy assignments, the activity log export to dev's workspace and dev's deployment records. It removes test's resource groups, budget and deployment records. Test's Key Vault stays soft-deleted for 90 days. The next test deployment's preflight with `-Fix` recovers it.
