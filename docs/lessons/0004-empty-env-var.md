# 0004. `readEnvironmentVariable` returns an empty string, not the default, when the variable is set but empty

- **Area:** Bicep parameters
- **Found in / fixed by:** PR #8

## What happened
With `AVD_LOCATION` set to an empty value (for example an unset CI variable), `location` compiled to `''`.

## Why
`readEnvironmentVariable('X', 'default')` only falls back when X is unset.

## Fix
`empty(readEnvironmentVariable('AVD_LOCATION', '')) ? 'northcentralus' : readEnvironmentVariable('AVD_LOCATION', '')`.

## Guard
`tests/Template.Tests.ps1`: Region override, Sizing overrides, and Auto shutdown ("takes an empty AVD_MONTHLY_BUDGET as no budget").

## Found again
`prod.bicepparam` read the budget with `int(readEnvironmentVariable('AVD_MONTHLY_BUDGET', '0'))`, which fails to compile when the variable is set but empty. It was found while adding the auto-shutdown budget trigger (decision 0011) and is now guarded with `empty()` in both parameter files.

## Rule
For optional environment variables in `.bicepparam`, guard with `empty(...)`, never rely on the second argument alone.
